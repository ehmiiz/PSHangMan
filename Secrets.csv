MSI;"MSI Stands for Micro-Star International and was 2010 one of the 3 biggest motherboard and GPU manufacturer!";"According to someone on the internet, No, MSI is not a good laptop. Sure it has a great graphics card and sure it has a great cooling system along with many other great features, but it fails in the most important category: reliability. I bought an MSI laptop for school because I had heard great things about the brand, but the laptop literally never worked. From the day I got it, it couldn’t watch videos, and that was just the beginning of my problems. After I had the computer for about 6 weeks, it started losing performance and crashing frequently to the point that I couldn’t run Microsoft Office or even transfer files onto a usb without without it freezing for 5 minutes and then crashing. I took it into Geek Squad twice and they couldn’t really do anything to help. I asked Best Buy online for a refund, but they wouldn’t give me one because the computer was too old and MSI wouldn’t refund the laptop either for reasons that I don’t really understand. It got so bad that I couldn’t use the laptop, so I went into Best Buy and they replaced it with the same make and model, but then that one was faulty as well. They refunded me again and I bought an ASUS with the money, a laptop which I have had no issues with for about a month now. The bottom line is that MSI is not reliable and I strongly suggest buying another brand.";
